            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Artificial hip joint replacements have transformed orthopaedic care by significantly improving mobility and quality of life. However, challenges like wear particle generation can lead to tissue damage and implant failure. This project leverages Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to model synovial fluid flow in a Tesla valve-integrated acetabular cup. The results demonstrate a novel approach to reducing wear particle accumulation, enhancing implant longevity, and mitigating complications like inflammation.

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                The project utilized <strong>Fusion 360</strong> for designing the acetabular cup with Tesla valve integration and <strong>ANSYS Fluent</strong> for simulating fluid dynamics. The Tesla valve's unidirectional flow properties were analyzed to mitigate backflow and wear particle transport. The methodology involved:

                <li>3D modeling of the acetabular cup with Tesla valve integration.</li>
                <li>Mesh generation with 0.2mm element size, resulting in 233,494 elements.</li>
                <li>Simulation of synovial fluid flow dynamics, focusing on velocity, pressure, and density distribution.</li>
                <li>Reversing inlet and outlet conditions to validate the Tesla valve's efficiency in controlling backflow.</li>
